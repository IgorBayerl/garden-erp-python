## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Flask)

1. **Navigate to the server directory**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Set up environment variables** (optional):
    Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and add your environment-specific variables.

6. **Run database migrations** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```

### Frontend (React)

1. **Navigate to the client directory**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project

#### Running the Backend

1. **Navigate to the server directory**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Run the Flask development server**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### Running the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the client directory**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. **Start the React development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

#### Running Both Together

You can run the backend and frontend simultaneously by opening two terminal windows or tabs and running the backend in one and the frontend in the other.

### Deployment

For deployment, you may want to build the React frontend and serve it with the Flask backend. The steps would vary depending on your deployment environment. Typically, you would:

1. Build the React app:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run build
    ```

2. Configure Flask to serve the built React files.

3. Deploy the Flask app to a server that supports Python, such as Heroku, AWS, etc.
